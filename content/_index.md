Hi there! My name is **Spycat**, and I am a Security Engineer and **OSCP** holder. I set up this website to document my infosec journey, including various projects and especially **CTF writeups**.

Any questions or feedback are very welcome!

I am available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spycatt) and via [Email](mailto:spycat18@pm.me).

Cheers!
